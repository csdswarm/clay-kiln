 *   permissions based off the url then we still need to grab permissions for
 *   _a_ station.  This applies to server-side non-content components and other
 *   contexts which would require a lot of work in order to figure out the
 *   affected stations.
 *
 * this workaround works well enough because most users will be assigned a
 *   single role across a set of domains.  If a user happens to have multiple
 *   roles assigned to different domains, then grabbing the first station will
 *   return potentially incorrect results.
 *
 * one long term solution would be to associate page uris with each component.
 *   e.g. when you add or remove a component to a page, the component would have
 *   a property 'pagesAssociatedWith' which gets updated accordingly.
