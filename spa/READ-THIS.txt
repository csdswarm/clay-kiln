In order to get this POC working:

cd claydemo/spa 

npm install

and run 

npm run-script build -- --mode=development

Then copy the built vue app.js file into the claydemo app public folder like so

mkdir -p ../app/public/dist && cp dist/app.js ../app/public/dist/app.js

Then navigate to a page and make sure you are in edit mode

example

http://localhost.demo.com/_pages/index.html?edit=true
